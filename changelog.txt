---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Added production, consumption and item flow views to insights window.
  Balancing:
    - Resistant medium biter percentage resistances to physical and explosion damage increased from 20 to 30. 
  Bugfixes:
    - Labolatory research speed bonuses were not doubled like other upgrades. This fix should make research speed bonus a little more interesting option but it might need some further buff.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.10
Date: 09. 07. 2023
  Features:
    - Increased font size for guide and map regeneration banner.
    - Guide windows is now of fixed size.
    - Added insights window for observers. It currently includes research view. Other views may come in the future once I figure out how to add them without impacting performance.
  Bugfixes:
    - Changelog is now properly displayed in the game.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Features:
    - Map regeneration banner is now closeable.
    - Added in-game guide :). It is accessible while being a spectator.
  Bugfixes:
    - Map regeneration banner is correctly shown after clicking regenerate map.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.8
Date: 04. 07. 2023
  Features:
    - Shared vision with your biters.
    - Changed debug, it debugs different things now and generates a lot less data.
    - Disabled vanilla victory.
  Balancing:
    - Small spitter nest cost: 50/25 -> 40/25.
    - Medium spitter nest cost: 40/40 -> 40/35.
    - Big biter nest cost: 25/50 -> 50/50.
    - Behemoth biter nest cost: 13/25 -> 25/25.
    - Adrenaline small biter attack cooldown: 20 -> 22.
  Bugfixes:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.7
Date: 30. 06. 2023
  Bugfixes:
    - Next attempt at fixing a crash related to crafting queue clearing before and after the game.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.6
Date: 29. 06. 2023
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a crash when in training mode you pick up the starter chest before starting the game.
    - Hopefully fixed a crash related to crafting queue clearing before and after the game.
    - Fixed a bug that would make the "map is being generated" banner visible after joining the game with the map already generated.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.5
Date: 29. 06. 2023
  Features:
    - Added descriptions to biter upgrade technologies. Finally!
    - The game now displays information that the map is currently being generated.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.4
Date: 28. 06. 2023
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a loophole allowing to bring extra items into the start of the game by having an active crafting queue at the start of the game.
  Balancing:
    - Increased the oil frequency twice. This should make it easier to progress behind mediums.
    - Yellow ammo damage 5->4, red ammo damage 12 -> 10. Yellow ammo with damage upgrade 2 still needs 2 bullets to kill small biter, while at damage upgrade 1 it needs 4. Also yellow ammo is now significantly weaker against medium biters. Generally gun turrets were much better than expected, especially due to much better upgrades than in vanilla.
    - Reintroduced grenade nerf (AoE radius 6.5 -> 5). Mediums are now much harder to get, enemies research time was trippled and spawning interval is longer so early game offense was nerfed hard.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.3
Date: 26. 06. 2023
  Features:
    - Biter groups now have a random chance (1% every 5s) to advance regardless of current state. This should help in case if a group gets stuck. 
    - Biter upgrades icons modified so that '+' sign is much clearer.
    - Nest icons are now properly tinted so it is easier to select correct recipe.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.2
Date: 18. 06. 2023
  Bugfixes:
    - Biter upgrades are now properly reset between games. 
    - The ammo damage bonuses seemd to not be reset once but this is no longer happening although I did not fix this. Checking if bonuses are set to none for both teams before starting is advised. 
  Balancing:
    - Nerfed flame thrower turret twice (on top on previous x3 nerf). 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.1
Date: 16. 06. 2023
  Balancing:
    - Drunken spitter attack range reduced by 1 (to small spitter + 2) as the huge range coupled with AI behavior makes them very likely to attack walls outside of turret range. The range was so high that even 2-wide walls directly around turrets were affected which was a bit too much.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0
Date: 12. 06. 2023
  Balancing:
    - Medium nests recipe changed from iron gear wheels + electronic circuit to steel splates + electronic circuit.
    - Big nests recipe changed from engine unit + advanced circuit to engine unit + plastic bar 
    - Behemoth nests recipe changed from flying robot frame + processing unit to flying robot frame + advanced circuit
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.8
Date: 10. 06. 2023
  Features:
    - Removed pseudo-optimization of increased map reveal time.
  Balancing:
    - All biter research times 10s -> 30s, biter upgrade research times 20s -> 30s.
    - Biter spawn interval 30s -> 40s.
    - Resistance upgrade physical percentage damage reduction 40% -> 20%, explosive damage reduction 40% -> 20%, fire 50% -> 30%.
    - Grenades restored to vanilla game.
    - Biter attack interval increased by approximately 35%.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.7
Date: 09. 06. 2023
  Features:
    - Significantly increased the time biters reveal map for.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.6
Date: 07. 06. 2023
  Balancing:
    - Mining productivity 1 now requires only automation-2.
    - Steelaxe mining speed bonus 100% -> 200% and handcrafting speed bonus 10% -> 20%.
    - Toolbelt handcrafting speed bonus 20% -> 40%.
    - Iron chests in starter pack 10 -> 30.
    - Long hand iserters in starter pack 10 -> 30.
    - Pipes in starter pack 5 -> 20.
    - Added 4 underground pipes to starter pack.
  Bugfixes:
    - Team Ready state should be properly reset after the game, this is true for both button state and real game state.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.5
Date: 05. 06. 2023
  Bugfixes:
    - Gun, armor and inventory slots are now properly cleared after game start and on respawn. No carrying over of items in those slots into next game, no free pistol and 10 ammo on game start and respawn.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.4
Date: 04. 06. 2023
  Bugfixes:
    - Spectators joining mid-game should not be able to regenerate map and break the match anymore.
  Balancing:
    - Drunken small spitters also gain +3 range (still 2 lower than gun turrets) and are spawned with 4/1 ratio with small spitters. Upgrade to small spitters, while has potential in later stages of the game, just doesn't seem to do anything against turrets and this should help a lot against them.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.3
Date: 01. 06. 2023
  Bugfixes:
    - Hopefully finally fixed rare regenerate map crash.
  Features:
    - Added game clock. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.2
Date: 30. 05. 2023
  Features:
    - Added logging to assist in finding the root cause of the rare crash after clicking regenerate map. When I try to reproduce it it works correctly so I'm adding logs to live version. 
    - Removed more obsolete debugs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.1
Date: 29. 05. 2023
  Bugfixes:
    - Loophole allowing for defensive (inside your base) nest placement closed. In the future this tactics may be reintroduced but it would require quite a lot of work to make nests placed inside your base have different parameters (less health and health regen) than those placed offensively.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 25. 05. 2023
  Balancing:
    - Small nests cost halved. Small biters/spitters were just too expensive to make it viable past a few "scouting" nests. Medium nests are not hard to get and are just significantly better, especially with upgrades.
    - Medium Spitter Nest cost reduced to 40/40. Biters (above small) are very expensive to kill without red ammo even without upgrade. Spitters, even upgraded, do not pose the same danger so their cost is reduced.
    - Big Spitter Nest cost reduced to 25/25. 
    - Behemoth Spitter Nest cost reduced to 13/13. 
    - Regenerative Behemoth Biter health regeneration per second increased from 120 to 300.
  Features:
    - Changelog should now be visible in game.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.9
Date: 24. 05. 2023
  Balancing:
    - Increased the free resource period from 30 minutes to 45 minutes. It should allow more aggresive play at the beginning of the game.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.8
Date: 15. 04. 2023
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a rare crash after clicking regenerate map (again).
    - Big and behemoth enemies are now spawning at correct intervals (30s).
    - Fixed a bug that cause AoE behemoth spitter to increase in size while attacking.
  Balancing:
    - Quadrupled area revealed by your biters (to 100x100).
    - AoE behemoth spitter attack area 5 -> 12 tiles. Those are supposed to end the game reasonably quickly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.7
Date: 05. 04. 2023
  Features:
    - Biter corpse lifetime further reduced from 2 to 1 minutes to make finding your corpse easier.
  Bugfixes:
    - Protected from rare crash after clicking regenerate map.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.6
Date: 02. 04. 2023
  Features:
    - Biter corpse lifetime reduced from 15 to 2 minutes to make finding your corpse easier.
    - Player respawn timer is now proportional to game length (game length / 60).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.5
Date: 02. 04. 2023
  Features:
    - Inventories are now cleared at the start of tournament-mode games.
    - Added 400 iron plates, 200 copper plates, 200 iron gear wheels, 200 electronic circuit and 100 wood to starter chest to allow immediate crafting of items.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 01. 04. 2023
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed grenade nerf not working.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.3
Date: 01. 04. 2023
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed respawn bug (again).
    - Fixed nests sometimes not being placed correctly.
    - Fixed map reveal not working on game's end.
  Features:
    - Removed a lot of obsolete performance debugs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.2
Date: 01. 04. 2023
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that resources were spawning on the basis on game tick instead of actual game length.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.1
Date: 30. 03. 2023
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a critical respawn bug.
  Balancing:
    - Artillery Spitter attack cooldown 10s -> 5s. Artillery Spitters seemed to work way to slow to be a game ending threat.
