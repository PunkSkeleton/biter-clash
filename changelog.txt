Version: 0.2.1
Date: 29. 05. 2023
  Bugfixes:
    - Loophole allowing for defensive (inside your base) nest placement closed. In the future this tactics may be reintroduced but it would require quite a lot of work to make nests placed inside your base have different parameters (less health and health regen) than those placed offensively.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 25. 05. 2023
  Balancing:
    - Small nests cost halved. Small biters/spitters were just too expensive to make it viable past a few "scouting" nests. Medium nests are not hard to get and are just significantly better, especially with upgrades.
    - Medium Spitter Nest cost reduced to 40/40. Biters (above small) are very expensive to kill without red ammo even without upgrade. Spitters, even upgraded, do not pose the same danger so their cost is reduced.
    - Big Spitter Nest cost reduced to 25/25. 
    - Behemoth Spitter Nest cost reduced to 13/13. 
    - Regenerative Behemoth Biter health regeneration per second increased from 120 to 300.
  Features:
    - Changelog should now be visible in game.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.9
Date: 24. 05. 2023
  Balancing:
    - Increased the free resource period from 30 minutes to 45 minutes. It should allow more aggresive play at the beginning of the game.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.8
Date: 15. 04. 2023
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a rare crash after clicking regenerate map (again).
    - Big and behemoth enemies are now spawning at correct intervals (30s).
    - Fixed a bug that cause AoE behemoth spitter to increase in size while attacking.
  Balancing:
    - Quadrupled area revealed by your biters (to 100x100).
    - AoE behemoth spitter attack area 5 -> 12 tiles. Those are supposed to end the game reasonably quickly.

Date: 30. 03. 2023
